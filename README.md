### Why I think the article is important

I found the article interesting because I've recently had a profound interest in how viruses work especially how people are able to create these types of ransomware and have it be spread worldwide. It really does make be very wary when going on the internet because while other people are enjoying social media, playing games, doing homework, a whole organization could be undergoing a cyber attack like this which can cause millions in damages.

## Milan's Review of Article
9/16/25: One thing I found interesting was how the "EternalBlue" vulnerability was initially created by the US National Security Agency (NSA). It’s fascinating to think that this Agency develops tools that can be used to cause great harm if they’re released to the wrong group of people. Additionally, the solution of buying the domain is pretty interesting to me as it seems the WannaCry group forgot to address this aspect of the worm.
